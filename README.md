> If you don't know, the thing to do is not to get scared, but to learn.

## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Create `Bool` variables and know when they should use them.
* Work with `Int` and `Double` types and perform math operations on those variables.
* Work with the comparison and logical operators.
* Work with conditionals and know when and how to use them.
* Work with switch statements covering what it is they learned in the readme.

## What the student can do at this point 

* Create variables and constants
* Is familiar with type annotations, type inference and string interpolation.
* Can create functions with return types.
* Is familiar with the String, Int, Double and Bool type.
* Work with if and else clauses.
* Knows how to make switch statements.

## Outline / Notes

* This particular lab in the playground file (which I've attached) can be fairly large, it will be covering all of unit 3 challenging the student on the various topics they learned.
* Start with easy wins for the student.
* The order of the questions don't have to follow along with the order of the topics introduced to them in the various readme's - mix it up.
* Combine the various topics they learned into the questions.
