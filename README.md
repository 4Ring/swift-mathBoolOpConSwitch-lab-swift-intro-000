## Fun with Basics!

##Instructions
Write a function "doIt" on the class ViewController which takes two paramters: "a" (which is of type String) and "b" (which is of type Float) and returns a Float.  

Here is how ````doIt```` should work:
* Return zero if "a" does not represent a whole number between 1 and 5 (inclusive).  
* Return zero if "b" is not between 10.5 and 15.0 (inclusive) or between 20.0 and 30.5 (inclusive).  
* Otherwise the product of "a" and "b".

Here are some examples:

````Swift
let a = doIt("2", 10.5)
// a = 21.0

let b = doIt("9", 10.5)
// b = 0.0

let c = doIt("2", 7)
// c = 0.0
````


NB your code might be more clear and debuggable if you break it up into multiple functions instead of having one "big" function.
